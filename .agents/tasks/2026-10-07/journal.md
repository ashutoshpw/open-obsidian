## R0.1 — preflight and traceability preparation

Read the Rust goal, prior goal/plan and module specifications. Local and remote main agree at d0ad51c. Baseline GitHub quality passes on all three desktop OSes. Compatibility refresh has upstream drift; loaded-plugin workflow remains queued. No local tests or executable validation were run.

Prepared all 196 legacy requirement rows with provisional Rust owners and fresh pending migration status, plus source/test/fixture/tooling inventory. These mappings need clause-by-clause review. GitHub identity w3research cannot push (HTTP 403), so no migration CI result or completed R0 milestone is claimed.

Next: restore write access, push this small R0.1 commit, inspect the exact-SHA migration and baseline CI jobs, then finish inventory review before R1.

## R0.1 — commit and push attempt

Local implementation commit: b1dbd9f. `git push origin main` returned exit 128 / HTTP 403, permission denied to w3research. The commit remains local; no migration CI was triggered and R0 remains in progress. Next action is restoring write access and pushing the prepared commit.

## R0.1 — write access restored

Connected repository identity now reports push permission. Both prepared commits pushed successfully to origin/main at 74049947d4816049ce187b9f3d23e1e804c52b59. Inventory, quality, desktop-build, renderer and loaded-plugin CI runs started; their results remain pending. Previous access failures remain historical evidence.

## R0.1 — GitHub CI acceptance

Inventory 37666896485, quality 37666896526, desktop build 37666896581, plugin renderer 37666896500 and loaded workflows 37666896720 passed for exact SHA 74049947d4816049ce187b9f3d23e1e804c52b59. All applicable baseline platform jobs passed. Evidence: evidence/r0.1-ci.json. R0.1 is complete; R0 remains in progress because the provisional ownership and runtime acceptance mapping still need review. No Rust feature or plugin certification status is promoted.

## CI preparation — native parallel steps

Before Rust implementation, group nine read-only contract/source checks in the quality job and both read-only post-package audits in the desktop job using GitHub Actions `parallel`. Preserve dependency installation, state validation, synthetic/runtime tests, compilation, sandbox setup and artifact production ordering. The group barrier requires every audit before artifact upload. Reconcile changed workflow inventory hashes while preserving original hashes. Validation is pending GitHub CI; no local checks were executed.

## CI preparation — verified on GitHub Actions

Parallel implementation f38c0ef40cd073cc8c6aada74adbf190b15ac0f2 passed quality 37667876075, desktop packaging 37667875966, inventory 37667875876, renderer 37667875978 and loaded-plugin 37667875884. All matrix jobs succeeded on Ubuntu/macOS/Windows. Quality timestamps show overlapping child steps. Evidence: evidence/parallel-ci.json. No local checks were run. CI preparation is complete; next migration operation remains R0.2 ownership/runtime-acceptance review.

## R0.2 — requirement and source ownership review

Reviewed 196 inherited acceptance rows against the Rust goal and added 14 migration-specific rows for Rust stack, CI-only testing, phased pushes, native UI, unsafe policy, plugin/runtime compatibility and credential migration. Assigned every one of 231 inventoried paths to a target crate/workspace owner; tests and fixtures also name the shared testkit role. Electron-only decisions/proposals are explicitly marked superseded; other Rust acceptance remains pending and historical passes stay historical. CI inventory is the next gate.

## R0.2 — decisions and acceptance review

Mapped all 196 inherited rows and added 15 migration-specific rows, including the early unchanged-JavaScript/DOM plugin feasibility gate. Corrected the target owner map across 231 inventoried files; historical pass evidence is preserved, Rust work starts pending, Electron architecture-only rows are superseded, and external rows remain external_pending. Recorded the Rust stack, vault hashing, plugin cohort, credential migration and GitHub CI decisions in decisions.md. Next gate: exact-SHA GitHub inventory and baseline workflows.

## R0.2 — mapping refinement

Corrected graph/UI, Canvas/document, platform configuration/storage, responsiveness and upstream-drift ownership. Added MIG-015 for an early cross-platform unchanged-JavaScript/DOM plugin feasibility gate before broad native UI investment. The reviewed inventory now carries 211 rows: 196 inherited product clauses and 15 Rust migration clauses. Rust acceptance stays pending; 11 Electron-only proposals are explicitly superseded and 10 external requirements remain pending.

## R0.2 — GitHub CI acceptance

Exact SHA d79e500d18fe87c23c7617bdc5fcdd9c10ef7c74 passed the migration inventory (37669022715), quality (37669022778), desktop build (37669022762), plugin renderer (37669022845) and loaded-plugin workflows (37669022789). All required jobs and platform matrices passed. The quality and desktop workflows also passed with the new GitHub Actions parallel-step groups. Evidence: evidence/r0.2-ci.json. R0 is complete.

## R1.1 — native Rust foundation started

Started a minimal Cargo workspace and native eframe shell based on the recorded Photocraft stack. The initial Rust CI will run only in GitHub Actions on Ubuntu, macOS and Windows. Workspace compilation does not complete plugin compatibility; MIG-015 remains the R1 gate before broad native UI work.

## R1.1 — first Rust CI feedback and correction

Exact-SHA Rust CI for 05ed884e1538a31d5229fe2e92f718f452030b48 caught Rustfmt differences and that eframe 0.36 implements `App::ui` rather than `App::update`. The first Linux formatting job and macOS/Windows compile jobs failed; the correction updates the UI entrypoint and applies the formatter layout reported by GitHub. GitHub Actions generated Cargo.lock in run 37669853135; its artifact digest is e12ecff53e0b4613a3077731c3862ff674f7db738d7dc8aa392a9dde20fd128b. The lockfile is now committed with the correction and Rust CI will enforce it with `--locked`. R1.1 remains in progress pending fresh three-OS CI.
