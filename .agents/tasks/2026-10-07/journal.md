## R0.1 — preflight and traceability preparation

Read the Rust goal, prior goal/plan and module specifications. Local and remote main agree at d0ad51c. Baseline GitHub quality passes on all three desktop OSes. Compatibility refresh has upstream drift; loaded-plugin workflow remains queued. No local tests or executable validation were run.

Prepared all 196 legacy requirement rows with provisional Rust owners and fresh pending migration status, plus source/test/fixture/tooling inventory. These mappings need clause-by-clause review. GitHub identity w3research cannot push (HTTP 403), so no migration CI result or completed R0 milestone is claimed.

Next: restore write access, push this small R0.1 commit, inspect the exact-SHA migration and baseline CI jobs, then finish inventory review before R1.

## R0.1 — commit and push attempt

Local implementation commit: b1dbd9f. `git push origin main` returned exit 128 / HTTP 403, permission denied to w3research. The commit remains local; no migration CI was triggered and R0 remains in progress. Next action is restoring write access and pushing the prepared commit.
